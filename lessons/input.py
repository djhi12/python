"""
In Python, the input() function is used to receive input from the user. It reads a line of text from the standard input (usually the keyboard), and returns it as a string.

"""

# The syntax for the input() function is as follows:
"""
input([prompt])

"""
# where the prompt is an optional string that is printed to the console before the user is asked to input data. If the prompt is not specified, the function simply waits for the user to enter input.


# Here is an example of using the input() function in Python:
name = input("What is your name? ")
print("Hello, " + name + "!")

# In this example, the input() function is used to ask the user for their name, and the resulting string is stored in the variable name. The program then prints a personalized greeting using the entered name.


"""
Note that the input() function always returns a string, even if the user enters a number or other data type. If you need to use the input as a number, you must explicitly convert it using the int() or float() functions.
