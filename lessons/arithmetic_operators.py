"""
Python has several arithmetic operators that can be used to perform mathematical operations on numerical values. These operators include:

Addition (+): This operator is used to add two numerical values together.

Subtraction (-): This operator is used to subtract one numerical value from another.

Multiplication (*): This operator is used to multiply two numerical values together.

Division (/): This operator is used to divide one numerical value by another. Note that in Python 3, division always returns a float value.

Floor Division (//): This operator is used to divide one numerical value by another and return only the integer part of the result.

Modulus (%): This operator is used to find the remainder when one numerical value is divided by another.

Exponentiation (**): This operator is used to raise one numerical value to the power of another.
"""

# Here are some examples of how these operators can be used in Python:
x = 10
y = 5

# Addition
print(x + y) # Output: 15

# Subtraction
print(x - y) # Output: 5

# Multiplication
print(x * y) # Output: 50

# Division
print(x / y) # Output: 2.0

# Floor Division
print(x // y) # Output: 2

# Modulus
print(x % y) # Output: 0

# Exponentiation
print(x ** y) # Output: 100000

# Note that the order of operations in Python follows the same rules as standard mathematics, with multiplication and division taking precedence over addition and subtraction. You can use parentheses to control the order of operations if needed.
