"""
    Python has several libraries and modules to handle numerical data. The most commonly used libraries for numerical data manipulation are:

        NumPy: NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. It provides efficient array operations, mathematical functions, and linear algebra routines. NumPy arrays are much faster and more efficient than Python lists for numerical operations.

        Pandas: Pandas is a popular library for data manipulation and analysis. It provides powerful data structures like DataFrames and Series, which make it easy to work with tabular data. Pandas also provides tools for data cleaning, aggregation, and merging.

        Matplotlib: Matplotlib is a library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python. It provides a wide range of charts and plots for data visualization, including scatterplots, line charts, bar charts, and histograms.

        SciPy: SciPy is a library for scientific computing in Python. It provides advanced mathematical functions, numerical integration, optimization, and signal processing tools.

        Statsmodels: Statsmodels is a library for statistical modeling and inference in Python. It provides tools for regression analysis, time series analysis, hypothesis testing, and data exploration.

Overall, these libraries provide a powerful toolkit for working with numerical data in Python.
