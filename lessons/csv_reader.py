"""
The csv.reader is a built-in Python module for reading CSV (Comma Separated Values) files. It allows you to parse the contents of a CSV file and convert it into a format that can be easily manipulated using Python.

Here's an example of how to use csv.reader to read a CSV file:
"""

import csv

# Open the CSV file
with open('data.csv', 'r') as file:
    # Create a CSV reader object
    csv_reader = csv.reader(file)

    # Iterate over each row in the CSV file
    for row in csv_reader:
        # Process the data in each row
        print(row)

"""
In this example, we first open the CSV file called 'data.csv' using the open function. We pass the file object to csv.reader to create a CSV reader object called csv_reader.

We then iterate over each row in the CSV file using a for loop, and csv_reader automatically parses the row into a list of values. Each value corresponds to a cell in the CSV file.

You can access the values in each row using indexing. For example, row[0] would give you the value in the first column, row[1] would give you the value in the second column, and so on.

You can perform various operations on the data within the loop, such as printing the values or storing them in variables for further processing.

Remember to replace 'data.csv' with the path to your own CSV file.

Note that the csv.reader assumes that the CSV file is formatted with commas as the delimiter. If your CSV file uses a different delimiter, you can specify it using the delimiter parameter when creating the csv_reader object. For example, if your CSV file uses a tab character as the delimiter, you can use csv.reader(file, delimiter='\t').

# Example Program
import csv

# Open the CSV file
with open('data.csv', 'r') as file:
    # Create a CSV reader object
    csv_reader = csv.reader(file)

    # Skip the header row
    header = next(csv_reader)

    # Initialize a variable to store the total sales
    total_sales = 0

    # Iterate over each row in the CSV file
    for row in csv_reader:
        # Extract the relevant columns
        date = row[0]
        product = row[1]
        price = float(row[2])
        quantity = int(row[3])

        # Perform some operations on the data
        sales = price * quantity
        total_sales += sales

        # Print the results
        print(f"On {date}, {quantity} units of {product} were sold for ${sales:.2f}")

    # Print the total sales
    print(f"\nTotal sales: ${total_sales:.2f}")

"""
In this example, we assume that the CSV file has the following structure:

Date,Product,Price,Quantity
2023-01-01,Apple,1.25,10
2023-01-02,Orange,0.75,20
2023-01-03,Banana,0.50,15

"""

"""
The program starts by opening the CSV file 'data.csv' and creating a csv_reader object.

The next(csv_reader) statement skips the header row of the CSV file and moves the reader's internal pointer to the first data row.

Inside the for loop, we extract the relevant columns from each row. In this case, we assume that the first column contains the date, the second column contains the product name, the third column contains the price, and the fourth column contains the quantity.

We then perform some operations on the data, calculating the sales for each row by multiplying the price by the quantity. We also accumulate the total sales in the total_sales variable.

Finally, we print the sales results for each row and display the total sales at the end.

Remember to replace 'data.csv' with the path to your own CSV file.
