"""
    In Python, the title() method is a string method that returns a new string with the first character of each word in the original string capitalized, and all other characters in lower case. This method does not modify the original string, but instead creates a new string with the modified formatting.
"""

# Here's an example:
original_string = "the quick brown fox"
new_string = original_string.title()
print(new_string)

# Output: The Quick Brown Fox

# As you can see, the title() method capitalized the first letter of each word in the original string. This method can be useful when you want to format text for display or presentation purposes.
