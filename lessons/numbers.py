"""
    In Python, "numbers" is a module that provides a hierarchy of numeric abstract base classes. These abstract base classes can be used to define numeric types that support various mathematical operations.

    The "numbers" module defines three abstract base classes:

    "Number" - the base class for all numeric types in Python, including integers, floating-point numbers, and complex numbers.
    "Complex" - the abstract base class for complex numbers.
    "Real" - the abstract base class for real numbers.
    These abstract base classes can be used as superclasses to define new numeric types. For example, if you want to define a new complex number class, you can subclass the "Complex" abstract base class and implement the necessary methods.

    In addition to the abstract base classes, the "numbers" module also provides several concrete classes that represent specific types of numbers, such as "Fraction" (rational numbers), "Decimal" (fixed-precision decimal numbers), and "Complex" (complex numbers).

# To use the "numbers" module, you can simply import it and use the provided classes as needed. For example:
import numbers

x = 3
y = 3.14
z = 2 + 3j

print(isinstance(x, numbers.Number)) # True
print(isinstance(y, numbers.Number)) # True
print(isinstance(z, numbers.Number)) # True
