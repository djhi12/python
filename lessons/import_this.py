"import this" is a special command in Python that imports "The Zen of Python," a collection of guiding principles for writing computer programs in the Python language. It was written by Tim Peters, a well-known Python developer.

When you run "import this" in a Python interpreter or script, you will see a set of 19 aphorisms or principles that encourage good coding practices. These principles are meant to be concise and memorable, and they serve as a sort of ethos for the Python programming community.

Here are the 19 principles of "The Zen of Python" that you will see when you run "import this":

1. Beautiful is better than ugly.
2. Explicit is better than implicit.
3. Simple is better than complex.
4. Complex is better than complicated.
5. Flat is better than nested.
6. Sparse is better than dense.
7. Readability counts.
8. Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
9. Although practicality beats purity.
10. Errors should never pass silently.
11. Unless explicitly silenced.
12. In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
13. There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
14. Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
15. Now is better than never.
16. Although never is often better than *right* now.
17. If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
18. If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
19. Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
