"""
In Python, a parameter is a special kind of variable that represents an input to a function or method. Parameters are defined within the parentheses of a function or method definition and provide a way for the caller of the function to pass values to it.

"""

# For example, in the following function definition, "x" and "y" are parameters:
def add_numbers(x, y):
    return x + y


# When the function is called, the values passed in for "x" and "y" are referred to as arguments:
result = add_numbers(2, 3)

# In this case, the value of "x" is 2 and the value of "y" is 3.


"""
Python supports different types of parameters, including:

    Required parameters: These are parameters that must be provided when the function is called. If a required parameter is not provided, a "TypeError" will be raised.

    Default parameters: These are parameters that have a default value specified in the function definition. If a default parameter is not provided, the default value will be used.

    Variable-length parameters: These are parameters that can accept any number of arguments. There are two types of variable-length parameters: *args (for positional arguments) and **kwargs (for keyword arguments).

    Keyword-only parameters: These are parameters that can only be passed as keyword arguments, not positional arguments. They are defined after a single asterisk (*) in the parameter list.
