"""
    In Python, the format() method is used to format strings. It allows you to insert values into a string in a specific order or position, or to format the string with specific formatting options.
"""

# Here's an example of how to use the format() method:
name = "John"
age = 30

print("My name is {} and I am {} years old.".format(name, age))

# In this example, {} acts as a placeholder for the values we want to insert into the string. We pass the values for name and age as arguments to the format() method, and they are inserted into the string in the order they appear.


# We can also use numbered placeholders to specify the order in which the values should be inserted:
name = "John"
age = 30

print("My name is {1} and I am {0} years old.".format(age, name))

# In this example, we use {1} and {0} to specify the order in which the values should be inserted. The first argument passed to format() (age) is inserted into the string at position {0}, and the second argument (name) is inserted at position {1}.


# The format() method also supports various formatting options, such as specifying the number of decimal places for a float, or the minimum width of a field. Here's an example:
pi = 3.141592653589793

print("The value of pi is approximately {:.2f}.".format(pi))

# In this example, the :.2f format specifier is used to round the value of pi to 2 decimal places.


# These are just a few examples of how to use the format() method in Python. It's a powerful and flexible tool for formatting strings, and can be used in a variety of different ways depending on your needs.
