"""
    In Python, "lower()" is a built-in string method that returns a new string in all lowercase letters.
"""

# Here is an example of how to use the "lower()" method in Python:
string = "HELLO WORLD"
lower_string = string.lower()
print(lower_string)

# In the above example, the "lower()" method is used to convert the string "HELLO WORLD" to all lowercase letters. The output of the code will be:

# hello world


# As you can see, the "lower()" method converted all the uppercase letters in the string to lowercase. This method is very useful when you need to compare strings in a case-insensitive manner or when you want to convert a string to lowercase for better readability.
