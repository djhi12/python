"""
    In Python, integers are a built-in data type that represents whole numbers, both positive and negative, without any decimal or fractional parts. Integers are represented using the int class in Python.

# Here are some examples of integer values in Python:
x = 42
y = -17
z = 0

# In addition to basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, Python provides a number of other operations that can be performed on integers, including bitwise operations, exponentiation, and comparison operators.


# Here are some examples of basic arithmetic operations with integers in Python:
a = 7 + 3    # a is now 10
b = 7 - 3    # b is now 4
c = 7 * 3    # c is now 21
d = 7 / 3    # d is now 2.33333 (Note: This is floating-point division)
e = 7 // 3   # e is now 2 (Note: This is integer division)
f = 7 % 3    # f is now 1 (Note: This is the remainder of integer division)
g = 7 ** 3   # g is now 343 (Note: This is exponentiation)

# Python also provides a number of built-in functions for working with integers, such as abs(), divmod(), pow(), round(), and max()/min().
