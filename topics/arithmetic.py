"""
Suppose we have two variables, a and b, with the following values:

a = 4
b = 5
We also have the following expressions:

result1 = 3 * (a - b)
result2 = 3 * a - b
result3 = 4 ** 3 ** 2
result4 = (4 ** 3) ** 2
result5 = 4 ** (3 ** 2)

Your task is to evaluate each of these expressions and determine their respective results.

# Define variables

b = 5

# Calculate and print the results

result2 = 3 * a - b

result3 = 4 ** 3 ** 2
