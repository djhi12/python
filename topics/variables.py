"""
Python variables are containers used to store data values. Unlike other programming languages, Python does not require you to declare the data type of a variable before assigning a value to it. Instead, the data type of a variable is determined dynamically at runtime based on the value assigned to it.

"""

# You can assign a value to a variable using the equal sign (=) operator. For example:
x = 5

# In the above example, the variable x is assigned the value of 5. You can also assign multiple variables at once by separating the values with commas, like this:


x, y, z = 1, 2, 3
# In the above example, x is assigned the value 1, y is assigned the value 2, and z is assigned the value 3.


# You can use variables in Python to perform various operations, including arithmetic, string manipulation, and more. For example:
x = 5
y = 10
z = x + y
print(z)  # Output: 15

# In the above example, x is assigned the value 5, y is assigned the value 10, and z is assigned the value of x + y, which is 15. The print() function is then used to display the value of z on the console.
