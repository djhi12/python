"""
In Python, variable names are case-sensitive and can consist of letters, numbers, and underscores. However, variable names cannot start with a number, and they should not contain spaces or special characters.

It is recommended to use descriptive names that reflect the purpose of the variable, making your code easier to read and understand. Also, it's good practice to follow the PEP 8 style guide for Python code, which suggests using lowercase for variable names, with words separated by underscores, like my_variable.

Python has some reserved keywords that cannot be used as variable names, such as if, else, while, for, def, and others. Trying to use a reserved keyword as a variable name will result in a syntax error.
