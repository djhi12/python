# Missing function or method docstring
"""
A docstring is a string that provides documentation for a function or method. It is typically placed as the first line after the function or method definition and is enclosed in triple quotes (\""").

# Missing module docstringPylint
"""
The error message you're encountering, "Missing module docstringPylint," suggests that you have Pylint installed, and it's reporting an issue with a missing module docstring in your code. Pylint is a popular Python static code analysis tool that checks for various coding standards and potential errors.

Pylint expects modules (Python files) to have a docstring at the beginning of the file to provide a description of the module's purpose. To resolve this error, you can add a docstring to the module.

Here's an example of how to add a module docstring:
"""

"""
This module contains functions for performing XYZ operations.
"""

def my_function():
    """This function performs XYZ operation."""
    # Function implementation goes here

"""
In the above example, the triple-quoted string at the beginning of the file serves as the module docstring. You can replace the description with an appropriate explanation of what the module does.

Once you have added the module docstring, you can re-run Pylint to verify that the error has been resolved.

# Missing function or method docstringPylint
"""
The error message you're encountering, "Missing function or method docstringPylint," indicates that Pylint is reporting a missing docstring for a function or method in your code. Pylint expects functions and methods to have docstrings to provide documentation and improve code readability.

To resolve this error, you can add a docstring to the function or method in question. Here's an example:
"""

def my_function(arg1, arg2):
    """
    This function performs some operation.

    Args:
        arg1: The first argument.
        arg2: The second argument.

    Returns:
        The result of the operation.
    """
    # Function implementation goes here
    return result

"""
In the above example, the triple-quoted string immediately after the function definition serves as the function docstring. Inside the docstring, you can provide a description of what the function does, explain the arguments (if any), and document the return value (if applicable).

Make sure to replace the placeholders (e.g., arg1, arg2, result) with meaningful names based on your actual function implementation.

After adding the docstring to the function or method, you can re-run Pylint to verify that the error has been resolved.

# Import "pytest" could not be resolvedPylance
"""
The error message you're seeing, "Import 'pytest' could not be resolved," typically occurs when the Python interpreter or your IDE (Integrated Development Environment) cannot find the 'pytest' module or package. This error is specific to Pylance, which is the language server used by some Python IDEs, including Visual Studio Code.

Here are a few steps you can take to resolve this issue:

1. Ensure pytest is installed: Make sure you have pytest installed in your Python environment. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

pip install pytest

If pytest is already installed, you might consider updating it to the latest version by running:

pip install --upgrade pytest


Confirm the correct Python interpreter: Verify that your IDE is using the correct Python interpreter where pytest is installed. Sometimes, IDEs can have multiple interpreters configured, and the wrong one may be selected. Check your IDE's settings or preferences to ensure the correct interpreter is chosen.

Refresh the IDE's IntelliSense or language server: If you're using Visual Studio Code, try restarting the editor or reloading the window (Ctrl+Shift+P and then select "Reload Window") to refresh the IntelliSense and language server. This can help Pylance recognize the pytest module.

Check for Pylance configuration: If the issue persists, check if there are any specific configurations for Pylance in your IDE. Look for settings related to Python paths or workspace-specific settings that might affect module resolution. Ensure that the directories containing the pytest package are included in the relevant configuration settings.

By following these steps, you should be able to resolve the "Import 'pytest' could not be resolved" error and use pytest in your Python projects.
