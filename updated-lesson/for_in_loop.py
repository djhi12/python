# In Python, the for in loop is used to iterate over a sequence (such as a list, tuple, or string) or other iterable objects (such as a dictionary or set) and perform a set of operations on each element of the sequence.


# Example Program
# define a list of numbers
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

# initialize a variable to store the sum
even_sum = 0

# iterate over the numbers in the list
for num in numbers:
    # check if the number is even
    if num % 2 == 0:
        # add the number to the sum
        even_sum += num

# print the sum of the even numbers
print("The sum of the even numbers in the list is:", even_sum)

# This program defines a list of numbers and uses a for in loop to iterate over each number in the list. For each number, the program checks if it's even (by using the modulo operator % to check if the remainder of the number divided by 2 is 0). If the number is even, it's added to the even_sum variable. Finally, the program prints the sum of all the even numbers in the list.
