"""
An f-string in Python is a way to format a string that was introduced in Python 3.6. It allows you to embed expressions inside string literals, using a special syntax.

To create an f-string, you start the string with the letter 'f', and then inside the string, you can include expressions inside curly braces '{}'. The expressions will be evaluated at runtime, and their values will be inserted into the string.
"""

# For example, if you have two variables x and y, you can use an f-string to create a string that includes their values like this:
x = 10
y = 20
print(f"The value of x is {x} and the value of y is {y}")

# When you run this code, the output will be: The value of x is 10 and the value of y is 20


# You can also include expressions inside the curly braces, such as arithmetic operations, function calls, and more. Here is an example:
x = 10
y = 20
print(f"The sum of x and y is {x + y}")

# This will output: The sum of x and y is 30

# F-strings are a powerful way to create formatted strings in Python, and they can make your code more concise and readable.
