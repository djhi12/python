Problem Statement:

Suppose you're tasked with solving a series of mathematical operations and analyzing some Python code. Here are the tasks you need to complete:

Calculate the sum of 45 and 72.
Assign the value 7 to the variable x and the value 3 to the variable y.
Find the sum of variables x and y.
Store the sum of variables x and y in a variable named "total".
Determine the data type of variable x.
Determine the data type of the number 10.5.
Lastly, print the results of each calculation and display the data types of variables x and 10.5.

"""

45 + 72
x = 7
y = 3
x + y
total = x + y
type(x)
type(10.5)

print()
print(45 + 72)
print(x)
print(y)
print(x + y)
print(total)
print(type(x))
print(type(10.5))
print()
