"""
    In Python, "\t" is an escape sequence that represents a horizontal tab character. When a horizontal tab character is encountered in a string, it moves the cursor to the next horizontal tab stop. This is typically equivalent to moving the cursor forward a certain number of spaces, where the number of spaces depends on the current position of the cursor.
"""

# Here's an example:
print("Hello\tworld!")

# This code will output: Hello   world!

# Note that there are three spaces between "Hello" and "world!" because the tab character represents moving the cursor forward to the next tab stop. The default tab stop distance in Python is usually 8 spaces, but this can vary depending on the application or platform.
