Problem Statement: Data Type and Type Conversion

Write a Python program that accomplishes the following tasks:

Create a variable named word and assign the string value 'word' to it.
Print the data type of the variable word.
Calculate the integer value resulting from truncating the float 5.2 (i.e., remove the decimal part) using the int() function.
Print the result of the truncation.

Your program should display the data type of word and the truncated integer value.
