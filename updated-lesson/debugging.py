"""
Debugging is the process of identifying and fixing errors or bugs in a program. In Python, there are several tools and techniques you can use to debug your code.

Print Statements: One of the simplest and most effective ways to debug code is by using print statements to output the value of variables and expressions at various points in the code. This can help you identify where a problem is occurring and what might be causing it.

Debugger: Python comes with a built-in debugger called "pdb" that can be used to step through code and examine variables at different points in the execution. You can start the debugger by adding the line "import pdb; pdb.set_trace()" to your code at the point where you want to start debugging.

Logging: Another way to debug code is by using logging statements to record events and values in the code. You can use the built-in "logging" module in Python to create log messages at different levels of severity, such as "debug", "info", "warning", and "error".

IDEs: Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) like PyCharm, Visual Studio Code, and Spyder have built-in debugging tools that allow you to step through code, set breakpoints, and examine variables in real-time.

Unit Testing: Writing automated tests for your code can also help you identify and fix bugs. By creating test cases that cover different scenarios and inputs, you can ensure that your code behaves correctly and consistently.

Overall, the key to successful debugging is to approach it systematically, using a combination of tools and techniques to identify and fix errors in your code.
