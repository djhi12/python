"""
Objective: Write a Python program that performs basic arithmetic operations on two numbers using arithmetic operators.

Instructions:
Open your preferred Python editor or IDE (Integrated Development Environment).

Create a new Python file.

Start by defining two variables num1 and num2 and assign them values (e.g., num1 = 10, num2 = 3).

Directly perform the following arithmetic operations on these numbers:
Addition
Subtraction
Multiplication
Division
Modulus
Exponentiation

Use the appropriate arithmetic operators for each operation.

Print the results of each operation using print() statements.

Save the file with a descriptive name, for example, arithmetic_operations.py.

Run the program.

Observe the output, which will display the results of various arithmetic operations on the assigned numbers.

Analyze the code to understand how each arithmetic operation is performed using Python's arithmetic operators.

Experiment with changing the values of num1 and num2 to see how it affects the results.

Challenge: Try adding additional arithmetic operations or modifying the program to take user input for the numbers.

Challenge: Explore other Python arithmetic operators that were not used in the initial code and try implementing them.

Save your changes and, if necessary, ask questions or seek clarification.

Happy coding!
