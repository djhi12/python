Problem Statement: Arithmetic Challenge

You are tasked with solving a series of arithmetic problems using Python. Each problem corresponds to a specific arithmetic operation.

Task 1: Addition
Compute the sum of 5 and 3.

Task 2: Subtraction
Find the result of subtracting 4 from 10.

Task 3: Multiplication
Calculate the product of 6 and 7.

Task 4: Division
Determine the quotient when 15 is divided by 3.

Task 5: Exponentiation
Compute 2 raised to the power of 4.

Task 6: Modulo
Find the remainder when 17 is divided by 5.

For each task, write a Python expression to perform the calculation and print the result.

Your output should look like this:

Addition: <result1>
Subtraction: <result2>
Multiplication: <result3>
Division: <result4>
Exponentiation: <result5>
Modulo: <result6>

Replace <result1>, <result2>, etc., with the computed results.
