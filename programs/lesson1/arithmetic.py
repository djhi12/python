Problem Statement: Arithmetic Challenge

You are tasked with solving a series of arithmetic problems using Python. Each problem corresponds to a specific arithmetic operation.

Task 1: Addition
Compute the sum of 5 and 3.

Task 2: Subtraction
Find the result of subtracting 4 from 10.

Task 3: Multiplication
Calculate the product of 6 and 7.

Task 4: Division
Determine the quotient when 15 is divided by 3.

Task 5: Exponentiation
Compute 2 raised to the power of 4.

Task 6: Modulo
Find the remainder when 17 is divided by 5.

For each task, write a Python expression to perform the calculation and print the result.

Your output should look like this:

Addition: <result1>
Subtraction: <result2>
Multiplication: <result3>
Division: <result4>
Exponentiation: <result5>
Modulo: <result6>

Replace <result1>, <result2>, etc., with the computed results.

"""
1. Addition: result_addition = 5 + 3 adds 5 and 3 together, resulting in 8.
2. Subtraction: result_subtraction = 10 - 4 subtracts 4 from 10, resulting in 6.
3. Multiplication: result_multiplication = 6 * 7 multiplies 6 and 7 together, resulting in 42.
4. Division: result_division = 15 / 3 divides 15 by 3, resulting in 5.0 (as it's a float division).
5. Exponentiation: result_exponentiation = 2 ** 4 raises 2 to the power of 4, resulting in 16.
6. Modulo: result_modulo = 17 % 5 finds the remainder when 17 is divided by 5, resulting in 2.
