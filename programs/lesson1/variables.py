Problem Statement:

You are tasked with creating a Python program that calculates the sum and product of two given numbers, a and b. Your program should perform the following steps:

Define two variables, a and b, and assign them the values 5 and 10 respectively.
Calculate the sum of a and b, storing the result in a variable named c.
Calculate the product of a and b, storing the result in a variable named d.
Output the results in the following format:

"The sum of a and b is c."
"The product of a and b is d."

"""

# Define variables
a = 5
b = 10

# Perform some operations using variables
c = a + b
d = a * b

# Output the results
print("The sum of", a, "and", b, "is", c)
print("The product of", a, "and", b, "is", d)
