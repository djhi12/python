"""Define a Python function named perform_arithmetic_operations that takes no arguments. Inside the function, prompt the user to input two numbers, convert them to floats, perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division), and display the results. Ensure to handle the case where the second number is zero for the division operation.

After defining the function, call it to execute the code. Test your function with various sets of numbers to validate its accuracy.

Here's a template to help you get started:
"""


def perform_arithmetic_operations():
    pass
    # Your code for user input and arithmetic operations goes here


# Call the function to execute the code
perform_arithmetic_operations()
