Addition: Add num1 and num2 together. Store the result in a variable (e.g., sum_result).
Subtraction: Subtract num2 from num1. Store the result in a variable (e.g., difference_result).
Multiplication: Multiply num1 by num2. Store the result in a variable (e.g., product_result).
Division: Divide num1 by num2. Store the result in a variable (e.g., division_result).

Display the Results:
Print out the computed results using formatted strings (f-strings):
Display the sum:
Display the difference:
Display the product:
Display the division:

Execute the Code:
